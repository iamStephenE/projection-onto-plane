# projection-onto-plane
This is a simple program that uses linear algebra concepts to project a 3d shape onto a 2d plane.

In this program, the shape (which is a cube) can be rotated around, and it can be adjusted.
Moreover, since it uses the idea of presepective projection, you can adjust the distance of the projection.
